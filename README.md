## What Is It?
SecOps Steward is a platform to execute high-privilege operations in isolated environments, sequenced via a Workflow. This allows complex, multi-step operations to be easily created without sacrificing security.

## Take a Look
There is a demo site which shows off the interface and basic features that cannot make changes to resources and is not access-controlled. That can be found at [demo.secopssteward.com](http://demo.secopssteward.com).

## Want More?
There is extensive documentation, including deployment instructions, for SecOps Steward at [docs.secopssteward.com](https://docs.secopssteward.com)!
